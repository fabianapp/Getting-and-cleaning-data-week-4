Create a tidy data set

First of all I've downloaded the data linked to from the course website that represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.

I stored the data sets in local data frames and looking to their dimensions I've merged them in order to create a single data set.

I've selectet only measurements about "mean" and "standard deviation" and I've replaced the activity ID with activity name and I've renamed variables in a more descriptive way in order to make the data set more understandable.

Finally I've created a tidy data set "my_analysis.txt", containing the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
